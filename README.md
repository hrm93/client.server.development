# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code is essential for the longevity and scalability of any software project. To achieve this, I focus on clear and consistent naming conventions, modular design, and comprehensive documentation.
For instance, in the CRUD Python module I developed for Project One, I ensured that each function had a single responsibility, making the code easier to debug and extend.
The use of docstrings and comments provided clarity on the purpose and functionality of each part of the code. This approach allowed me to seamlessly connect the CRUD module to the dashboard widgets in Project Two, demonstrating the benefits of modular design.
In the future, this module could be repurposed or extended for other projects requiring database interactions, saving development time and ensuring consistent data management practices.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, my approach to problem-solving involves careful planning, iterative development, and constant testing.
For the Grazioso Salvare project, I began by thoroughly analyzing the client's requirements, then designed a solution that met their specific needs—integrating a MongoDB database with a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard.
This project differed from previous assignments in its complexity and the real-world application of the skills I've learned. I employed strategies such as breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks, and using version control to track progress.
In future projects, I would apply similar techniques, along with a focus on scalability and performance optimization, to create robust and efficient databases that cater to diverse client requests.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve complex problems by developing algorithms, writing code, and creating systems that improve efficiency and productivity. My work on the Grazioso Salvare project illustrates how these skills can be applied to real-world scenarios.
By developing a dashboard that allows the company to filter and analyze animal data effectively, I’ve helped them streamline their search-and-rescue training process. This not only enhances their operational efficiency but also contributes to their mission of saving lives.
In a broader sense, the work of computer scientists is crucial in driving technological innovation, automating tasks, and providing solutions that address the challenges faced by businesses and society at large.
